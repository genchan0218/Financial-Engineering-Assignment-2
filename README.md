# Monte Carlo Portfolio Optimization (Long & Short Strategies)

This repository contains the implementation and report for a Monte Carlo‚Äìbased portfolio optimization assignment. We explore long-only and long‚Äëshort portfolio strategies across three assets, maximizing expected return under risk constraints using stochastic programming.

## üöÄ User Instructions

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.7+
- Install dependencies via:

  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
  ```

### How to Run

#### *Option A: Jupyter Notebook*
1. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Monte_Carlo_In_Python.ipynb
   ```

2. Run all cells to simulate 10,000 portfolios with and without short positions.

3. Output plots and statistics will be displayed and optionally saved.

#### *Option B: Python Script*
1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python Monte_Carlo_In_Python.py
   ```

2. Output:
   - Side-by-side efficient frontier plot (`.pdf`)
   - Summary statistics printed in terminal

## üß™ Testing Instructions
- Confirm output plot (`portfolio_optimization_monte_carlo_side_by_side.pdf`) is generated
- Modify asset return or risk parameters and rerun to test flexibility
- Compare behavior of `shorts_ok=True` vs `shorts_ok=False` in simulations

## üìä Design Summary
1. **Define Inputs**: Expected returns, volatilities, correlation matrix  
2. **Simulate Returns**: Generate synthetic data using multivariate normal distribution  
3. **Monte Carlo Optimization**: Simulate 10,000 random portfolios  
4. **Compare Strategies**: With and without short selling  
5. **Visualize Efficient Frontier**: Show risk-return tradeoffs in a side-by-side plot  
6. **Summarize Statistics**: Print descriptive metrics for both strategies

## ü§ñ Use of AI Assistants
AI tools, including **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**, were used to support the development of this assignment in the following ways:
- Clarifying concepts like stochastic programming and efficient frontier  
- Generating boilerplate Python functions for simulations and plotting  
- Assisting in drafting summary interpretation and Markdown formatting  
- Reviewing structure for clarity and readability  

All final code, design decisions, and interpretations were manually reviewed and refined by the student to meet academic standards.
